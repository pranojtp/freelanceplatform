FreelanceHub: The All-in-One Freelancer Productivity Platform
About the Project
FreelanceHub is a micro-SaaS platform designed to eliminate the need for freelancers to juggle multiple tools for their business operations. Instead of paying for separate subscriptions for proposals, invoicing, and project management, FreelanceHub integrates these critical functions into a single, seamless environment.

The Problem it Solves
Freelancers waste significant time and money switching between disjointed applications (e.g., one for proposals, another for Kanban boards, and a third for invoicing). This fragmentation leads to workflow inefficiencies, data inconsistencies, and unnecessary administrative overhead.

The FreelanceHub Solution
FreelanceHub provides a central dashboard where freelancers can manage their entire client lifecycle, from initial outreach with a professional Proposal, to tracking progress via a Kanban board, to securing final payment with a branded Invoice.

‚ú® Key Features
Authentication & Security: Secure user registration/login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Proposal Management: Create professional, templatized proposals and track their status in real-time (Sent, Viewed, Accepted, Rejected).

Project Management: Visualize and manage project tasks using interactive Kanban boards and detailed task lists. Assign priorities, set deadlines, and track progress.

Invoicing: Generate professional, itemized invoices (PDF generation ready) linked directly to completed projects.

Payment Integration: Seamless integration with Razorpay to allow clients to pay invoices securely online with various payment methods.

Responsive UI: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a clean, intuitive, and fully responsive experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
